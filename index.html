            <p>Dukey is a 12 year old Pug, Jack Russell mix and lives with me and my family in Ireland. He is a very small dog, but acts much bigger than his size. He may look like an old man but still has the personality of a new born puppy.</p>
            <p>Dukey`s favorite treat are rich tea cookies, as well as anything that falls off of the table at meal time. The rest of the family may call him the family dog, but both him and I know he`s really my dog, and one of my best friends.</p>

            <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>
            <p>My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since</p>

        <div><h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <img src="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" width = "400" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera">
    
                <p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.</p> 
                <P>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.</P>

                <img src ='images/chonks.jpg' alt="Furry white and dark brown ragdoll." width="400">
                    <p>Chunky Doll or as he prefers to respond to, Chocks, is a 4-year-old ragdoll. His name was inspired by his breed and looks. As a kitten, he was even chunkier and blended right in with a fluffy white rug we had that he loved playing hide and seek in. He’s a very lazy but playful cat, only playful when he feels like it.</p>
                    <p>He’s a pretty but very difficult cat as he’s white but hates showers and loves rolling around in the house collecting dust. To get him into a bath we often have to lure him in with fake human treats. And even then he jumps right out of the bath and runs around the whole bathroom making the floors wet. Nevertheless, he’s a very soft, cuddly, and loving cat.</p>
